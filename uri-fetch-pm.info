Description: Smart URI fetching/caching
DescDetail: <<

URI::Fetch is a smart client for fetching HTTP pages, notably
syndication feeds (RSS, Atom, and others), in an intelligent,
bandwidth- and time-saving way. That means:

* GZIP support

  If you have Compress::Zlib installed, URI::Fetch will automatically
  try to download a compressed version of the content, saving
  bandwidth (and time).

* Last-Modified and ETag support

  If you use a local cache (see the Cache parameter to fetch),
  URI::Fetch will keep track of the Last-Modified and ETag headers
  from the server, allowing you to only download pages that have been
  modified since the last time you checked.

* Proper understanding of HTTP error codes

  Certain HTTP error codes are special, particularly when fetching
  syndication feeds, and well-written clients should pay special
  attention to them. URI::Fetch can only do so much for you in this
  regard, but it gives you the tools to be a well-written client.

  The response from fetch gives you the raw HTTP response code, along
  with special handling of 4 codes:

  - 200 (OK)
  
  Signals that the content of a page/feed was retrieved successfully.

  - 301 (Moved Permanently)
  
  Signals that a page/feed has moved permanently, and that your
  database of feeds should be updated to reflect the new URI.

  - 304 (Not Modified)

  Signals that a page/feed has not changed since it was last fetched.

  - 410 (Gone)

  Signals that a page/feed is gone and will never be coming back, so
  you should stop trying to fetch it.
