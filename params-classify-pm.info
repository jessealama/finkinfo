Description: Argument type classification
DescDetail: <<
This module provides various type-testing functions. These are
intended for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of
data they are operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave
differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
functions in C++).

There are two flavours of function in this module. Functions of the
first flavour only provide type classification, to allow code to
discriminate between argument types. Functions of the second flavour
package up the most common type of type discrimination: checking that
an argument is of an expected type. The functions come in matched
pairs, of the two flavours, and so the type enforcement functions
handle only the simplest requirements for arguments of the types
handled by the classification functions. Enforcement of more complex
types may, of course, be built using the classification functions, or
it may be more convenient to use a module designed for the more
complex job, such as Params::Validate.

This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
systems that can't handle XS.
