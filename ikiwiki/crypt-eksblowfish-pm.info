Description: The Eksblowfish block cipher
DescDetail: <<
An object of this type encapsulates a keyed instance of the
Eksblowfish block cipher, ready to encrypt and decrypt.

Eksblowfish is a variant of the Blowfish cipher, modified to make the
key setup very expensive. ("Eks" stands for "expensive key schedule".)
This doesn't make it significantly cryptographically stronger, but is
intended to hinder brute-force attacks. It also makes it unsuitable
for any application requiring key agility. It was designed by Niels
Provos and David Mazieres for password hashing in OpenBSD. See
Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt for the hash algorithm. See
Crypt::Eksblowfish::Blowfish for the unmodified Blowfish cipher.

Eksblowfish is a parameterised (family-keyed) cipher. It takes a cost
parameter that controls how expensive the key scheduling is. It also
takes a family key, known as the "salt". Cost and salt parameters
together define a cipher family. Within each family, a key determines
an encryption function in the usual way. See
Crypt::Eksblowfish::Family for a way to encapsulate an Eksblowfish
cipher family.
