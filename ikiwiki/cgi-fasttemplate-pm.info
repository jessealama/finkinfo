Description: Manage templates and variable interpolation
DescDetail: <<
CGI::FastTemplate manages templates and parses templates replacing
variable names with values.  It was designed for mid to large scale web
applications (CGI, mod_perl) where there are great benefits to separating
the logic of an application from the specific implementation details.

For example using FastTemplate it is possible to:

- build multilingual applications

- allow users to select high-bandwidth or text-only versions of an
application

- let graphic designers work on templates independantly of the
programmers

- share the responsibility of interface design

CGI::FastTemplate has the following attributes:

* Speed

FastTemplate doesn't use eval, and parses with a single regular
expression.  It just does simple variable interpolation (i.e. there is
no logic that you can add to templates - you keep the logic in the
code).  That's why it's has 'Fast' in it's name!

* Efficiency

FastTemplate functions accept and return references whenever possible,
which saves needless copying of arguments (hashes, scalars, etc).

* Flexibility

The API is robust and flexible, and allows you to build very complex
HTML documents or HTML interfaces.  It is 100% perl and works on Unix
or NT.  Also, it isn't restricted to building HTML documents -- it
could be used to build any ascii based document (e.g. postscript, XML,
email).
