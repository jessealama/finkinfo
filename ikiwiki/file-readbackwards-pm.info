Description: Read a file backwards by lines
DescDetail: <<
This module reads a file backwards line by line. It is simple to use,
memory efficient and fast. It supports both an object and a tied
handle interface.

It is intended for processing log and other similar text files which
typically have their newest entries appended to them. By default files
are assumed to be plain text and have a line ending appropriate to the
OS. But you can set the input record separator string on a per file
basis.
