Description: Library for working with Amazon S3 buckets and keys
DescDetail: <<

Amazon::S3 provides a portable client interface to Amazon Simple
Storage System (S3).

"Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make
web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a simple
web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any
amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any
developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its
own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits
of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers".

To sign up for an Amazon Web Services account, required to use this
library and the S3 service, please visit the Amazon Web Services web
site at http://www.amazonaws.com/.

You will be billed accordingly by Amazon when you use this module and
must be responsible for these costs.

To learn more about Amazon's S3 service, please visit:
http://s3.amazonaws.com/.

This need for this module arose from some work that needed to work
with S3 and would be distributed, installed and used on many various
environments where compiled dependencies may not be an
option. Net::Amazon::S3 used XML::LibXML tying it to that specific and
often difficult to install option. In order to remove this potential
barrier to entry, this module is forked and then modified to use
XML::SAX via XML::Simple.

Amazon::S3 is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Net:Amazon::S3
that trades some performance in return for portability.
