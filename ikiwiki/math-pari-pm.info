Description: Perl interface to PARI
DescDetail: <<
This package is a Perl interface to famous library PARI for
numerical/scientific/number-theoretic calculations. It allows use of
most PARI functions as Perl functions, and (almost) seamless merging
of PARI and Perl data. In what follows we suppose prior knowledge of
what PARI is (see ftp://megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari, or
Math::libPARI).

DescPort: <<
In principle, one could make this package depend on pari-gp, and this
package wouldn't download, recompile, and store its own copy of the
PARI/GP.  But the upstream instructions for this use case are stern
enough ("This is a non-yet-supported way to build the library; try it
only if anything else fails") to discourage me from trying this saner
route.  So we bite a bullet and keep a version of PARI/GP around
specifically for this package, the pari-gp package notwithstanding.
