Description: Diffie-Hellman key exchange system
DescDetail: <<
Crypt::DH is a Perl implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
system. Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm by which two parties can agree
on a shared secret key, known only to them. The secret is negotiated
over an insecure network without the two parties ever passing the
actual shared secret, or their private keys, between them.
