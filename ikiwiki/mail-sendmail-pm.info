Description: Simple platform independent mailer
DescDetail: <<
Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script. Only
requires Perl 5 and a network connection.

Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a hash with the
message to send and sends it. It is intended to be very easy to setup
and use.

Features:

* Automatic time zone detection, Date: header, MIME quoted-printable
  encoding (if MIME::QuotedPrint installed), all of which can be
  overridden.

* Bcc: and Cc: support.

* Allows real names in From:, To: and Cc: fields

* Doesn't send an X-Mailer: header (unless you do), and allows you to
  send any header(s) you want.

* Configurable retries and use of alternate servers if your mail
  server is down

* Good plain text error reporting
