The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
is a library of test problems for automated theorem proving (ATP)
systems. The TPTP supplies the ATP community with:

* A comprehensive library of the ATP test problems that are available
today, in order to provide an overview and a simple, unambiguous
reference mechanism.

* A comprehensive list of references and other interesting information
for each problem.

* New generalized variants of problems whose original presentation is
hand-tailored towards a particular automated proof.

* Arbitrary size instances of generic problems (e.g., the N-queens
problem).

* A utility to convert the problems to existing ATP formats. Currently
the Bliksem, CARINE, Dedam, DFG, DIMACS, FINDER, KIF, Otter, PROTEIN,
Prover9, PTTP, Satchmo, SCOTT, SEM, SETHEO, THINKER, Waldmeister
formats are supported, and other formats can be easily produced.

* General guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system
evaluation.

The principal motivation for the TPTP is to support the testing and
evaluation of ATP systems, to help ensure that performance results
accurately reflect the capabilities of the ATP system being
considered. A common library of problems is necessary for meaningful
system evaluations, meaningful system comparisons, repeatability of
testing, and the production of statistically significant results. The
TPTP is such a library.
