Description: Markup ASCII with correct HTML typography
DescDetail: <<

This module is a thin wrapper for John Gruber's SmartyPants plugin for
various CMSs.

SmartyPants is a web publishing utility that translates plain ASCII
punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML
entities. SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:

Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into "curly" quote HTML entities
Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into "curly" quote HTML
entities Dashes (-- and ---) into en- and em-dash entities Three
consecutive dots (...) into an ellipsis entity SmartyPants does not
modify characters within <pre>, <code>, <kbd>, <script>, or <math> tag
blocks. Typically, these tags are used to display text where smart
quotes and other "smart punctuation" would not be appropriate, such as
source code or example markup.
