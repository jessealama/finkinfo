DescDetail: <<
Developed in the LogiCal project, the Coq tool is a formal proof
management system: a proof done with Coq is mechanically checked by
the machine.

In particular, Coq allows:

* the definition of functions or predicates,

* to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,

* to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,

* to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".

Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
Constructions" extended by a modular development system for theories.
    
Coq also includes

* a mecanism for automatic generation of certified programs from
  proofs of their specifications

* a graphical user interface based on gtk (CoqIde) see screenshots)

* a documentation tool (coqdoc)

* dependecy and makefile generation tools for Coq *coq_makefile and
  coqdep)

* a preprocessor for TeX files that include Coq commands (coq-tex)
