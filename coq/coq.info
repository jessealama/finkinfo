Description: Calc. of Ind. Constructions: proof assistant
DescDetail: <<
Developed in the LogiCal project, the Coq tool is a formal proof
management system: a proof done with Coq is mechanically checked by
the machine.

In particular, Coq allows:

* the definition of functions or predicates,
* to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,
* to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,
* to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".

Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
Constructions" extended by a modular development system for theories.

Coq also includes
* a mechanism for automatic generation of certified programs from
  proofs of their specifications
* a graphical user interface based on gtk (CoqIde)
* a documentation tool (coqdoc)
* dependency and makefile generation tools for Coq (coq_makefile and coqdep)
* a preprocessor for TeX files that include Coq commands (coq-tex)
