SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) and Friends is a database of
information on English words useful for creating high-quality word
lists suitable for use in spell checkers of most dialects of
English. The database primary contains information on how common a
word is, differences in spelling between the dialects if English,
spelling variant information, and (basic) part-of-speech and
inflection information.

SCOWL itself is a compilation of the information in the database into
a set of simple word lists that can be combined to create speller
dictionaries of various sizes and dialects (American, British (both
-ise and -ize) and Canadian).
