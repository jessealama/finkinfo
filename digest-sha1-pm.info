Description: Perl interface to the SHA-1 algorithm
DescDetail: <<
The Digest::SHA1 module allows you to use the NIST SHA-1 message
digest algorithm from within Perl programs. The algorithm takes as
input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 160-bit
"fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

In 2005, security flaws were identified in SHA-1, namely that a
possible mathematical weakness might exist, indicating that a stronger
hash function would be desirable. The Digest::SHA module implements
the stronger algorithms in the SHA family.

The Digest::SHA1 module provide a procedural interface for simple use,
as well as an object oriented interface that can handle messages of
arbitrary length and which can read files directly.
