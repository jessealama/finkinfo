Description: 
DescDetail: <<
noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while
remaining as simple as possible.  Its primary advantages are
simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence.  noweb uses 5
control sequences to WEB's 27.  The noweb manual is only 3 pages; an
additional page explains how to customize its LaTeX output.  noweb
works ``out of the box'' with any programming language, and supports
TeX, latex, and HTML back ends.  A back end to support full hypertext
or indexing takes about 250 lines; a simpler one can be written in 40
lines of awk.  Noweb does not prettyprint natively, but supports
prettyprinting through such third-party filters as pretzel and dpp.
