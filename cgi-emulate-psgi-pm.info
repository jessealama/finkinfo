  DescDetail: <<
This module allows an application designed for the CGI environment to
run in a PSGI environment, and thus on any of the backends that PSGI
supports.

It works by translating the environment provided by the PSGI
specification to one expected by the CGI specification. Likewise, it
captures output as it would be prepared for the CGI standard, and
translates it to the format expected for the PSGI standard using
CGI::Parse::PSGI module.
