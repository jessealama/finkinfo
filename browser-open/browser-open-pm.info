Description: Open a browser in a given URL
DescDetail: <<
The functions optionaly exported by this module allows you to open
URLs in the user browser.

A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the
first one found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known
commands are checked.

The "open_browser" uses the system() function to execute the
command. If you want more control, you can get the command with the
"open_browser_cmd" or "open_browser_cmd_all" functions and then use
whatever method you want to execute it.
