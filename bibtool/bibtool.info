BibTeX provides an easy to use means to integrate citations and
bibliographies into LaTeX documents. But the user is left alone with
the management of the BibTeX files. The program BibTool is intended to
fill this gap. BibTool allows the manipulation of BibTeX files which
goes beyond the possibilities---and intentions---of BibTeX. The
possibilities of BibTool include

* Pretty-printing BibTeX data bases adjustable by lots of parameters.

* Syntactic checks with error recovery superior to BibTeX and helpful
  error messages.

* Semantic checks can be specified by the user.

* Sorting and merging of BibTeX data bases according to a free
  definable sort key.

* Generation of uniform reference keys according to predefined rules
  or according to an own specification.

* Selecting references used in one publication which are found by
  analyzing an .aux file.

* Selecting references by a set of criteria (regular expressions).

* Controlled rewriting of fields utilizing regular expressions to
  specify the rewriting rules.

* Macro (String) expansion to eliminate the need of extra string
  definitions.

* Collecting statistics about one or more BibTeX data bases.
