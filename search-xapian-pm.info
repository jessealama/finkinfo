Description: Frontend to the Xapian C++ search library
DescDetail: <<
This module wraps most methods of most Xapian classes. The missing
classes and methods should be added in the future. It also provides a
simplified, more 'perlish' interface to some common operations, as
demonstrated above.

There are some gaps in the POD documentation for wrapped classes, but
you can read the Xapian C++ API documentation at
http://xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/annotated.html for details of
these. Alternatively, take a look at the code in the examples and
tests.

If you want to use Search::Xapian and the threads module together,
make sure you're using Search::Xapian >= 1.0.4.0 and Perl >= 5.8.7. As
of 1.0.4.0, Search::Xapian uses CLONE_SKIP to make sure that the perl
wrapper objects aren't copied to new threads - without this the
underlying C++ objects can get destroyed more than once.

If you encounter problems, or have any comments, suggestions, patches,
etc please email the Xapian-discuss mailing list (details of which can
be found at http://xapian.org/lists).
