Icon is a very high level general-purpose programming language with
extensive features for processing strings (text) and data
structures. Icon is an imperative, procedural language with a syntax
that is reminiscent of C and Pascal, but with semantics at a much
higher level.

Icon has a novel expression-evaluation mechanism that integrates
goal-directed evaluation and backtracking with conventional control
structures. It has a string scanning facility for pattern matching
that avoids the tedious details usually associated with analyzing
strings. Icon's built-in data structures include sets and tables with
associative lookup, lists that can be used as vectors or stacks and
queues, and records.

Icon is a strongly, though not statically, typed language. It provides
transparent automatic type conversion: For example, if an integer is
used in an operation that requires a string, the integer is
automatically converted to a string.

Several implementations of Icon have high-level graphics facilities
with an easily programmed window interface.

Icon manages storage automatically. Objects are created as needed
during program execution and space is reclaimed by garbage collection
as needed. The sizes of strings and data structures are limited only
by the amount of available memory.
