Description: Stringified data structures
DescDetail: <<
Given a list of scalars or reference variables, writes out their
contents in perl syntax. The references can also be objects. The
content of each variable is output in a single Perl statement. Handles
self-referential structures correctly.

The return value can be evaled to get back an identical copy of the
original reference structure.

Any references that are the same as one of those passed in will be
named $VARn (where n is a numeric suffix), and other duplicate
references to substructures within $VARn will be appropriately labeled
using arrow notation. You can specify names for individual values to
be dumped if you use the Dump() method, or you can change the default
$VAR prefix to something else. See $Data::Dumper::Varname and
$Data::Dumper::Terse below.

The default output of self-referential structures can be evaled, but
the nested references to $VARn will be undefined, since a recursive
structure cannot be constructed using one Perl statement. You should
set the Purity flag to 1 to get additional statements that will
correctly fill in these references. Moreover, if evaled when
strictures are in effect, you need to ensure that any variables it
accesses are previously declared.

In the extended usage form, the references to be dumped can be given
user-specified names. If a name begins with a *, the output will
describe the dereferenced type of the supplied reference for hashes
and arrays, and coderefs. Output of names will be avoided where
possible if the Terse flag is set.

In many cases, methods that are used to set the internal state of the
object will return the object itself, so method calls can be
conveniently chained together.

Several styles of output are possible.
