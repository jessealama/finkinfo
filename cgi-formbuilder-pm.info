Description: Generate and process stateful CGI forms
DescDetail: <<
Do you hate generating, processing, and validating CGI forms? Do you
love Perl?

FormBuilder is the answer. It's an extremely fast, robust Perl module
with a ridiculous set of features.

Here's the main stuff that I [the author] think is cool:

* DWIMmery

This module tries to "Do What I Mean". Tell it the fields you care
about, and it takes care of all the stupid HTML and JavaScript
generation and processing for you. It also gives you back the correct
values that you want. It will even label your fields automatically
with human-readable names.

* Input field abstraction

You simply define your fields and their options, and FormBuilder will
take care of figuring out what the best HTML representation is. It
will then generate the appropriate input fields (text, select, radio,
etc), even changing any JavaScript actions appropriately.

* Easy handling of defaults

Just specify a hash of values to use as the defaults for your
fields. This will be searched case-insensitively and displayed in the
form. What's more, if the user enters something via the CGI that
overrides a default, when you use the field() method to get the data
you'll get the correct value.

* Correct stickiness

Stickiness is a PITA. FormBuilder correctly handles even multiple
values selected in a multiple select list, completely integrated with
proper handling of defaults.

* Robust field validation

Form validation sucks, and this is where FormBuilder is a big help. It
has tons of builtin patterns, and will even generate gobs of
JavaScript validation code for you. You can specify your own regexps
as well, and FormBuilder will even check multivalued select lists
correctly. See the full list of built-in patterns.

* Multiple submit mode support

FormBuilder allows you to reliably tell whether the person clicked on
the "Update" or "Delete" button of your form, normally a big pain.

* Template driver support

FormBuilder can natively "drive" several major templating engines:

  * HTML::Template
  * CGI::FastTemplate
  * Text::Template
  * Template Toolkit

If you want to build a complete form application with a template in
less that 20 lines of Perl, FormBuilder is for you.

* Internationalized, Customizable Messaging

Sick of US-centric modules? You can customize every single message
that FormBuilder outputs for your locale. See the full messages list.

* Simple Interface

Heck, I specialized in User Interface Design for my degree!

* Extensive Documentation
