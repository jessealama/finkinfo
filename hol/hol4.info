DescDetail: <<
HOL 4 ("Kananaskis") is the latest version of the HOL automated proof
system for higher order logic: a programming environment in which
theorems can be proved and proof tools implemented. Built-in decision
procedures and theorem provers can automatically establish many simple
theorems. An oracle mechanism gives access to external programs such
as SAT and BDD engines. HOL 4 is particularly suitable as a platform
for implementing combinations of deduction, execution and property
checking.
