Description: Common Upgradeability Description Format
DescDetail: <<
libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
document describe an upgrade problem, as faced by package managers in
popular package-based GNU/Linux distributions.

A CUDF document consists of a package universe and of a user
request. The package universe describes all packages known to the
package manager, a subset of which (the package status) denotes the
package being currently installed on the target machine. The user
request denotes a change to the package status as requested by the
user.

A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a solution describing the
resulting package status (if any) implementing the user request, as
found by a package manager.

libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.

This package contains all the development stuff you need to use
libCUDF in your OCaml programs.
