Description: Graph library for OCaml
DescDetail: <<
* It provides an easy-to-use graph data structure together with
  several operations and algorithms over graphs.  It is a reasonably
  efficient imperative data structure for directed graphs with
  vertices and edges labeled with integers.
* Then ocamlgraph provides several other graph implementations for
  those not satisfied with the one above. Some are persistent
  (imutable) and other imperative (mutable). Some are directed and
  other are not. Some have labels for vertices, or labels for edges,
  or both. Some have abstract types for vertices. etc.  These
  implementations are written as functors: you give the types of
  vertices labels, edge labels, etc. and you get the data structure as
  a result.
* Finally, ocamlgraph provides several classic operations and
  algorithms over graphs.  They are also written as functors
  i.e. independently of the data structure for graphs. One consequence
  is that you can define your own data structure for graphs and yet
  re-use all the algorithms from this library -- you only need to
  provide a few operations such as iterating over all vertices, over
  the successors of a vertex, etc.
